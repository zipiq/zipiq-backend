## Critical Weaknesses Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Reliability Issues

**Single Point of Failure - Arweave Wallet**
- One compromised wallet stops all archival operations

**Database Connection Management**
- Basic connection pooling without optimization
- No connection health monitoring
- Missing transaction rollback mechanisms

**Queue Persistence**
- In-memory queue lost on server restart

- Manual recovery required after downtime

### üêå Performance Bottlenecks

**Sequential Processing**
- Chunks uploaded to IPFS then Arweave sequentially
- No parallel processing of multiple streams
- Blocking operations impact user experience

**Missing Caching Layer**
- No Redis or memory cache for frequent queries
- Database hit for every metadata request
- No CDN integration for content delivery

**Inefficient Resource Usage**

### üîê Security Vulnerabilities

**Key Management**
- Environment variables for secrets (better than hardcoded)
- No key rotation mechanism

**Request Security**
- File upload size limits but no overall request limits
- Missing CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- No audit logging for security events

**Network Security**

- Missing DDoS protection at application level

### üè≠ Production Readiness Gaps

**Monitoring & Observability**
- No metrics collection (Prometheus, StatsD)
- Basic health checks without detailed diagnostics
- No distributed tracing for request flows
- Missing alerting system for failures

**Operational Procedures**
- Manual deployment process
- No database migration system
- Limited structured logging for debugging
- No disaster recovery procedures

**Infrastructure Management**
- No containerization (Docker)
- Missing CI/CD pipeline
- No automated testing in deployment
- No environment-specific configurations
